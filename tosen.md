## Payment

PayPal: only with PayPal bill for order over 15.-
I accept payment with Twint in case PayPal is not possible.

If the work in progress does not receive any answers in 24 hours, I will put the commission on standby and continue with other commissions in queue.
Every step is validated by the client. Modification of an already validated step will cost 15.- more.

+5.- for commissions without reference images (only a descrition, picture of fursuit or unclear drawing for example).

***

## Refund

The commission will be 100% refunded if it's not started yet.
In the case of cancelation from the customer after I started working, the amount will depend on how much time I already worked.
Finished commission will not be refunded.
If the commission is refunded, the customer can't use or share the WIPs.

***

## Stickers

There are only 2 WIPs: sketch and line art. Color and shading come together with the final version.
Stickers are only in the Chibi or Toony style.
It is mandatory to add my credit sticker.
It is forbidden to use stickers outside of a Telegram Sticker Pack or WhatsApp sticker pack. If the customer wishes to use it for another purpose, they must ask me first.

***

## Badges

Badges can be printed, laminated and fitted with a metal ring. Shipping to Europe is 5.-
The customer can print and laminate the badge themselves. I will provide the .png of the badge.
If the badge gets lost in shipping, I'll print another one and send it for free (if the commission with the customer went well).
If the badge broke when you're using it, I'll not refund or send another for free, I still can send you the .png of the badge so the customer can reprint it.

***

## Deadlines

I need enough time to do a commission, if you want it for a precise date, please, let me know the deadline if there is one.
I determine if I have enough time to make a deadline or not. I charge 20.- for a rush commission.
Commissions can be done in a few hours to a few weeks. It depends on my availability, health or workload. If I am sick or unable to work for more than 48h, the client will be informed.
It is preferable to commission me at the earliest time possible for me to make the deadline!
If I can't finish the commission before the deadline, if the customer asks for it, I can provide a partial refund (except if the delay was caused by a lack of answers by the customer or too many modifications).

***

## Privacy

If a commission (badge) is shipped, my adress must not be disclosed to anyone, it is only for back shipping.
I will use the customer's adress only to send commissions, the customer's adress will never be disclosed.
Customer's ID (for NSFW commissions) will remain private. You only need to show your full name and age.
It is possible to ask for a "private" commission, that means that I will not publish it on social media. I will charge 40% more if there is no public version (less examples in my portfolio).
It is possible to ask for commissions as a surprise: I will not share any WIP or finished drawing on my pages and groups until the customer says I can. It is preferable to tell me who the person is to avoid any sharing by accident.
Customers must not share any of my personal information. Any lack of respect toward me or my work will be punished.

***

## Customers can't :

* Redraw my work
* Modify my work
* Make a profit out of my work (except if agreed upon beforehand)
* Erase or crop my sign
* Take credit for my work

## Customers have to:

* Credit me whenever they post my work.

## Customers can :

* Print my work for personal use (posters, t-shirtâ€¦)
* Give my work as a reference to other artists.
* Crop the drawing without cropping my sign (except for profile picture)

***

If the customer need a modification (ex : resize the commission, get the .png file, etc...) it is possible to ask for it nicely, I don't charge minor modifications.
The customer has the rights on the character but not the drawing.
I might make a mistake while calculating the commission's price. If so, the customer can choose to pay the correct price or not, whatever the customer's choice, I will do the full commission requested.
Know that English is not my first language, so please, be patient if I take some time to understand your ideas.

***

By sending the payment, the client agrees to these Terms of Service
The same applies to free art receivers.
