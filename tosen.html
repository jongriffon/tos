<hr />
<h2 id="payment">Payment</h2>
<p>PayPal: only with PayPal bill for orders over 30 CHF</p>
<p>I accept payment with Twint or Paypal.</p>
<p>If the work in progress does not receive any answers in 24 hours, I
will put the commission on standby and continue with other commissions
in queue. Every step is validated by the client. Modification of an
already validated step will cost 15.- more.</p>
<p>+5.- for commissions without reference images (only a descrition,
picture of fursuit or unclear drawing for example).</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="refund">Refund</h2>
<p>The commission will be 100% refunded if it’s not started yet.</p>
<p>In the case of cancelation from the customer after I started working,
the amount will depend on how much time I already worked.</p>
<p>Finished commission will not be refunded.</p>
<p>If the commission is refunded, the customer can’t use or share the
WIPs.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="stickers">Stickers</h2>
<p>There is only one WIP: the sketch. Then a final version. I accept
small modifications to the final version.</p>
<p>Stickers are only in the Chibi, Toony or Mallow style.</p>
<p>It is mandatory to add my credit sticker.</p>
<p>Stickers can be used anywhere, with credit.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="badges">Badges</h2>
<p>Badges can be printed, laminated and fitted with a metal ring.
Shipping to Europe is 5 CHF</p>
<p>The customer can print and laminate the badge themselves. I will
provide the .png of the badge.</p>
<p>If the badge gets lost in shipping, I’ll print another one and send
it for free (if the commission with the customer went well).</p>
<p>If the badge broke when you’re using it, I’ll not refund or send
another for free, I still can send you the .png of the badge so the
customer can reprint it.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="deadlines">Deadlines</h2>
<p>I need enough time to do a commission, if you want it for a precise
date, please, let me know the deadline if there is one.</p>
<p>I determine if I have enough time to make a deadline or not. I charge
20.- for a rush commission.</p>
<p>Commissions can be done in a few hours to a few weeks. It depends on
my availability, health or workload. If I am sick or unable to work for
several days, the client will be informed.</p>
<p>It is preferable to commission me at the earliest time possible for
me to make the deadline!</p>
<p>If I can’t finish the commission before the deadline, if the customer
asks for it, I can provide a partial refund (except if the delay was
caused by a lack of answers by the customer or too many
modifications).</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>
<p>If a commission (badge) is shipped, my adress must not be disclosed
to anyone, it is only for back shipping.</p>
<p>I will use the customer’s adress only to send commissions, the
customer’s adress will never be disclosed.</p>
<p>Customer’s ID (for NSFW commissions) will remain private. You only
need to show your full name and age.</p>
<p>It is possible to ask for a “private” commission, that means that I
will not publish it on social media. I will charge 40% more if there is
no public version (less examples in my portfolio).</p>
<p>It is possible to ask for commissions as a surprise: I will not share
any WIP or finished drawing on my pages and groups until the customer
says I can.</p>
<p>Customers must not share any of my personal information. Any lack of
respect toward me or my work will be punished.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="customers-cant">Customers can’t :</h2>
<ul>
<li>Redraw my work</li>
<li>Modify my work</li>
<li>Make a profit out of my work (except if agreed upon beforehand)</li>
<li>Erase or crop my sign</li>
<li>Take credit for my work</li>
</ul>

<li>Give my work as a reference to other artists.</li>
<li>Crop the drawing without cropping my sign (except for profile
picture)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>If the customer need a modification (ex : resize the commission, get
the .png file, etc…) it is possible to ask for it nicely, I don’t charge
minor modifications.</p>
<p>The customer has the rights on the character but not the drawing.</p>
<p>I might make a mistake while calculating the commission’s price. If
so, the customer can choose to pay the correct price or not, whatever
the customer’s choice, I will do the full commission requested.</p>
<p>Know that English is not my first language, so please, be patient if
I take some time to understand your ideas.</p>
<p>There’s possibility the TOS would partially not apply for certain
situations, for example: a friend asking me NSFW art</p>
<p>Don’t forget I choose my workflow and do as much as is confortable
for me (my health) and to satisfy my customers as mush as I can.</p>
<p>I am always available to answer your questions or anything else, one
of my best quality is communication. I answer faster on Telegram and
Facebook, it’s possible I miss messages on Discord and Twitter.</p>
<hr />
<p>By sending the payment, the client agrees to these Terms of Service
The same applies to free art receivers.</p>
